# Alterman Tutoring - Static Site

This is a Next.js project for a static tutoring website, generated by Firebase Studio. All content is managed through simple JSON files, and the site is optimized for deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

### 1. Customize Your Content

All user-facing text, navigation, and settings are stored in `.json` files within the `/public/data/` directory. Open these files and replace the descriptive placeholders (e.g., `<your content here>`) with your own content.

- `site.json`: General site information, contact details, and key facts.
- `navigation.json`: Main navigation links for the header.
- `about.json`: Paragraphs for the "About" page.
- `subjects.json`: Details on tutoring subjects offered.
- `testimonials.json`: Customer testimonials.
- `tutoringStyle.json`: Description of your tutoring approach.
- `seo.json`: Page titles and descriptions for search engine optimization.

### 2. Install Dependencies

To run the development server or build the project, you first need to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the local development server to preview your changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## Building and Deployment

This site is configured to be exported as a static site, which can be hosted on any static hosting provider.

### Build for Production

To create a production-ready static build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files will be generated in the `out/` directory.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the `main` branch.

To enable it:

1.  Go to your repository's **Settings > Pages**.
2.  Under "Build and deployment," set the **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

The site will be deployed to the URL provided by GitHub Pages.
