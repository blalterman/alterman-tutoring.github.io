# **App Name**: MigrateEasy

## Core Features:

- Dashboard: Provide a clean and intuitive user interface to manage the migration process.
- Prototype Import: Allow users to upload and parse the structure of the existing prototype from various file formats (e.g., JSON, YAML).
- Structure Visualization: Display the parsed structure of the original prototype in a tree or hierarchical view.
- Transformation Rules: Enable users to define transformation rules between the old and new prototype formats.
- Next.js Structure: Display the structure of the new prototype format, as it will appear in Next.js.
- Code Generation: Automatically generate Next.js code snippets based on the transformation rules and the structure of the new prototype format.
- AI Code Suggestions: Use generative AI to analyze code snippets and recommend refactoring and performance optimizations that could be used in Next.js. The system uses a tool to determine the type of output.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) - A vibrant blue (#3399FF) to convey trust and reliability.
- Background color: HSL(210, 15%, 95%) - A very light blue-tinted gray (#F0F5FA) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) - A contrasting teal (#40BFB0) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. This provides a modern and readable aesthetic.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent different file types, data structures, and transformation rules.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with sufficient whitespace for improved readability and user experience.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during data loading, code generation, and transformation rule application.
